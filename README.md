### House-Price-Prediction using Pytorch
Using Kaggle dataset, a model is build to predict the price of houses based on different features.

Label Encoding is done for all categorical variables and Embedding layers of Artificial Neural Networks are formed using Pytorch.

Implemented Dropout to reduce overfitting and dependency of results on only some nn. Backpropagation is used to reduce losses and Root mean squared error is calculated using the train and test data.
